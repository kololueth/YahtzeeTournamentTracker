Reason for developing:

My brothers and I often played multi-day Yahtzee tournaments. We sometimes lost track of the physical scorecards in the mess of scorecards piled up from the number of games played. These were multi day tournaments. I created this program to automatically calculate the scores of our games and to manage our tournaments.

Application Description:

A web-based program that calculates Yahtzee scores and creates tournaments.
